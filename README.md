## Introduction

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. It is formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles. This program provides a simple and customizable way to draw the Sierpinski Triangle.

## Features

- Generate Sierpinski Triangles of varying depth.
- Customize colors and visual aspects of the generated triangles.
- Simple and efficient C++ implementation.
